Note :

1. At the time when the constructor generates new Promise object, it also generates pair of functions, 
called as "resolve" & "reject"

2. Generally, the exector function wraps some async/sync operations.

3. The exector is called as synchronous in nature.

4. At any point of time, if event loop has a choice to pick from microtask queue or callback queue then
it always prefer to choose the functions present inside the microtask queue.
